//! Realtime-safe log sink with an off-thread drainer.
//!
//! `docs/architecture.md` § Realtime logging describes the pattern:
//! the realtime path enqueues events into a lock-free queue and a
//! separate non-realtime thread drains them — formats, writes to
//! stderr, sends to a network sink, whatever. [`LogSink`] packages
//! that pattern so plugin authors don't have to thread together a
//! [`ring::Producer`](super::ring::Producer), a
//! [`ring::Consumer`](super::ring::Consumer), a shutdown signal, and
//! a [`JoinHandle`](std::thread::JoinHandle) themselves.
//!
//! # Realtime properties
//!
//! [`LogSink::log`] forwards directly to [`Producer::try_push`]: two
//! relaxed/acquire/release atomic ops plus a `T`-sized memcpy. No
//! allocation, no syscall. Drop the result if the queue is full
//! (returns `false`).
//!
//! Construction and destruction allocate and spawn/join a thread —
//! both run outside the realtime path (typically in
//! [`Plugin::instantiate`](crate::Plugin::instantiate) and
//! `cleanup`).
//!
//! # Drainer behaviour
//!
//! - The drainer thread polls the consumer at a fixed interval
//!   ([`DRAINER_POLL_INTERVAL`]). Latency is bounded by that
//!   interval plus whatever `drain_one` takes per event.
//! - When [`LogSink::drop`] runs it signals shutdown and joins the
//!   thread. The drainer performs a final pass to flush any events
//!   pushed between its last poll and the shutdown signal.
//! - The user-supplied `drain_one` closure runs on the drainer
//!   thread. If it panics, the drainer thread terminates; subsequent
//!   `log` calls will succeed (the queue may still have room) but
//!   events accumulate until the queue is full. The plugin's `run`
//!   keeps working — the log sink failing does not crash audio.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tympan_ladspa::realtime::log::LogSink;
//!
//! // Capacity 1024; drainer prints each event to stderr.
//! let logger = LogSink::<&'static str>::new(1024, |event| {
//!     eprintln!("plugin: {event}");
//! });
//!
//! // From the realtime path (in `Plugin::run`):
//! assert!(logger.log("audio buffer too small"));
//!
//! // When `logger` drops the drainer thread is joined; any
//! // remaining events are flushed first.
//! drop(logger);
//! ```
