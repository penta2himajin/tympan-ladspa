# tympan-ladspa

[日本語](./README.ja.md)

A Rust framework for writing LADSPA plugins.

`tympan-ladspa` provides Rust abstractions over the LADSPA (Linux Audio
Developer's Simple Plugin API) C interface, enabling Rust applications to
implement audio plugins suitable for hosts such as PipeWire's filter-chain,
Ardour, and other LADSPA-compatible processors.

## Status

**Design phase.** No implementation yet. See [`docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md)
for planned scope and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the
planned API design.

## Naming

*Tympan* — the tympanal organ of moths, a membrane-based ultrasound sensor
on the abdomen of pyralid and noctuid moths. Evolved to detect the
echolocation calls of bats. The name reflects the library's role: a thin
membrane between the host audio engine and user-space Rust code.
